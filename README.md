### Summery

This project, that I have named _Ariel's Grotto_, is an image sharing website for both professionals and non-professionals. It was created by following a Figma draft and was designed to work on:

_big screens_
![3x3 grid](./images/desktop-preview.png)

_medium screens_
![2x2 grid](./images/tablet-preveiw.png)

_small screens_
![single colunm](./images/phone-preveiw.png)

The website should flow from one size to another seemlessly.
